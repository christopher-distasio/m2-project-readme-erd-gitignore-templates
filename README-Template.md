# *Project Title*

*One Paragraph of project description goes here*

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

*What things you need to install the software and how to install them*

```
Give examples
```


### Installing

*A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running*

*Say what the step will be*

```
Give the example
```

*And repeat*

```
until finished
```

## Running the tests *(if there are any)*


*Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if there are any)*

### End-to-end tests *(if there are any)*

*Explain what these tests test and why (if there are any)*

```
Give an example 
```

### Coding style tests *(if there are any)*


*Explain what these tests test and why  (if there are any)*


```
Give an example
```

## API Endpoints

*It’s common for developers to show the various endpoints in their frontend and/or backend API/s as you would find in a third-party API provider. NOTE: You are NOT required to do this for the Milestone 2 Project.*

*This resource shows examples of different ways you can show your endpoints: https://github.com/bufferapp/README/blob/master/billing/api-endpoints.md*


## Schema Diagram

*You should likely be using a tool (an app, pen and paper, etc.) to make an ERD (Entity Relational Diagram) if you’re using a relational database or a schema diagram if you’re using a document (NoSQL) database. You can usually use the same tool for diagramming for either kind, but here are some top choices:*

*ERD: Usually the RDMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) platform being used (PgAdmin, etc.) provides a feature to allow making diagrams from tables you’ve already made in the app.*

*How to Make an ERD Diagram in PgAdmin4.*

*Draw.io — A Common Choice for ERD Diagrams, Flowcharts, Wireframes*

*NoSQL DB Schema Modeling App: https://nosqldbm.ru/#/*


*ERD Diagram Example:*

## License

*You don’t have to add a license to your Milestone 2 Project, but you can. It is a common part of a repo that specifies how the project can be used. Kinds of licenses allowing public use are very similar but have small differences that might matter for a specific project. The MIT or GNU general license are usually fine for a public repo.*

*This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details*


## Acknowledgments

 - *Hat tip to anyone whose code was used*
 - *Inspiration*
 - *etc*


## Post-MVP Plans

- *Also called stretch goals*
- *One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.*
- *Another that will be a stretch.*
- *Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)*


## IMPORTANT! REMOVE ALL TEXT IN ITALICS ABOVE AND ALL TEXT BELOW THIS POINT. THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT ALSO IT CAN BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS MAKING YOUR APP. ##


## Project Planning

| Date | Goals |
| ---- | ----- |
| Mon. 6/26| Discuss project guidelines and resources; create repo and README.md for the project; teams and decide on a topic to be approved by the instructors|
| Wed. 6/28 | stand up meetings; by break time after the first hour of class, all teams must have team members, tools and languages to use, someone assigned to be in charge of the project repo/s, and topic must be finalized; Work day in class; |     

DUE by class time on Saturday, July 1:

Each group:
- Has chosen a project idea
- Has had their project approved, 
- Has chosen/understand what tools to use for it
- Has a repo/repos set up according to best practices 
- Has agreed how the workflow is organized — at least who has ownership of the repo and is handing pull requests
- Has agreed on who is doing frontend and who is doing backend
- Has sent Chris a link to the project repo/s by Canvas email

| Date | Goals |
| ---- | ----- |
| Sat. 7/1 | Discuss deployment possibilities and begin preparation for it; Work day in class |
| Wed. 7/5 | Work day in class  |
| Sat. 7/8 | Your project should be deployed and all features contained in the app should work to satisfy all project requirements as shown on Canvas (or the same thing as a Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rayc4cBqavZ0XV7kgMiNLs0sBL44dgafEgaAQOMgfO0/edit?usp=sharing) The same requirements are also viewable and can be duplicated as a checklist here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XZd4I3_S_znzgsSt7oFbby6tMyHIQ6S4g6DaGCCimg/edit?usp=drivesdk |

## OPTIONAL (BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) POST-PROJECT STEPS:

Make a Demo: You can use Zoom or many other free/freemium tools to make a screen recording, but you should check out Loom. It is widely used for very professional-looking demos: https://www.loom.com/. Don’t be confused if you use Loom; the free tier is totally free and has all you need.

Here’s one I made for a project demo (which is nice to have for your resume/Github repo, too, but for this project you can make a simple one that doesn’t have to be so perfect): https://www.loom.com/share/389c0f9eec3c430e84ec8cb16c293614


After you finish making/deploying your game, make sure to update and finalize your README for the project. Remember, Github and your pinned projects are one of the most important ways for you to show potential employers your skill and professionalism.

Make sure your README follows this: 

- Remove any template text that doesn’t apply to your own information.

- Proofread your README before leaving it in your Github pinned projects! How-to: Copy the code and run it through a spell checker in Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Grammarly, etc., make any changes, then paste it back in. Also go over it yourself from the beginning to the end, reading it out loud to yourself or passing it off to a second pair of eyes to notice any other issues not caught by a spell- or grammar-checker.
