```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

Here are some important messages and programming points for you:

If you have an extension: 
You need to make a screen recording/video of you presenting your game. Remember to submit your deployment link to the Milestone 1 Project Submission page in Canvas and send a Canvas email to both Caleb and I with your presentation video attached or linked. You can use the resources about presentations we’ve already provided and the presentations on Panopto for guidance. You can use Zoom or many other free/freemium tools to make a screen recording, but you should check out Loom, which we mentioned in class. It is widely used for very professional-looking demos: https://www.loom.com/. Don’t be confused if you use Loom; the free tier is totally free and has all you need.

Here’s one I made for a project demo (which is nice to have for your resume/Github repo, too, but for this project you can make a simple one that doesn’t have to be so perfect): https://www.loom.com/share/389c0f9eec3c430e84ec8cb16c293614

(Optional but highly recommended) Post-project Steps:
After you finish making/deploying your game, make sure to update your Github README. Remember, Github and your pinned projects are one of the most important ways for you to show potential employers your skill and professionalism.

Make sure your README follows this: 

Add deployment section if you haven’t already
Remove all of the “training wheel” text and just leave your own words.
Delete the “Planning Schedule” section at the bottom of the page because it’s no longer relevant.
Proofread it! Copy the code and run it through a spell checker in Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Grammarly, etc., make any changes, then paste it back in. Also go over it yourself from the beginning to the end, reading it out loud to yourself or passing it off to a second pair of eyes to notice any other issues not caught by a spell- or grammar-checker. 

A tip for those adding more stretch goal features to their project: In order to keep your game (which is already awesome) working, consider making a new branch for the feature and then merging the new branch with the main branch when you’re sure the feature works correctly. This is a very common aspect of day-to-day dev workflow.


Here’s a site with both a video and written instructions showing you how to do that:https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches

(And here’s an awesome interactive website which is confusingly not all about git branching as it’s named but which looks great for learning Git in general: https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US)

In case you didn’t know, you can directly edit on Github itself! This is really helpful with on-the-fly kinds of changes like making changes to a README. Here’s a great how-to website if you want to try this: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files.

If you do this, notice that you need to make a commit, but you don’t have to make a separate action to push the commit because there’s nowhere for it to be pushed from! (If you make changes directly to a file on repo, make sure to use “git pull” in your local repo in VSCode so that you have the updated changes there). This is a really good point, too: You should ALWAYS pull before you commit/push changes to a file you know others could be using.

### Post-MVP Plans

XXX IMPORTANT! Replace the text below as you list what you would do to improve the game post-MVP AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)


XXX IMPORTANT! USE THIS SPACE FOR THE SCHEDULE WE END UP MAKING IN CLASS AND ADD ANY PERSONAL INFO AS NEEDED. THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT ALSO IT CAN BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS MAKING YOUR APP. BUT MAKE SURE TO DELETE ALL OF TEXT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THE PROJECT FINALLY XXX







## Project Planning

| Date | Goals |
| ---- | ----- |
| Mon. 5/1 | Discuss project guidelines and resources; create repo and README.md for the project. |
| Wed. 5/3 | Work day in class; make sure to have a repo with basic README.md finished. |     
| Sat. 5/6 | Work day in class     |
| Mon. 5/8 | Work day in class; make sure your project is deployed.      |
| Wed. 5/10 | Your project should be deployed and your game should work according to the rules and goals you’ve set for the game. Make sure you’re meeting all of the project requirements in the Canvas docs (or all here as a Google Doc: https://tinyurl.com/3f47whyx), also viewable and can be duplicated as a checklist here: https://tinyurl.com/yrryxmk8)  |  
| Sat. 5/13 | Submit your completed project. Present your project. |
